        <h3>Olga Mavridis</h3>
        <img src ="Olga.gif" ALIGN=”right” class = "p"/>
        <div class = "bio">My name is Olga Mavridis and I am a rising junior of class 2020 at Arcbishop Molloy High School. My passions have always been in math and science. When joining Girls Who Code, I thought it would be a great opportunity to expose myself to something new. I've always been told that I should learn how to code, and this summer I realized how important coding is. Coding can be implemented into anything. If coding didn't exist we would't have apps, websites, and technology. As I finish high school, college, and begin my career, I hope to continue this journey, as this is only the beginning.</div><br CLEAR=”left”/>

        <h3>Jin Li</h3>
        <img src ="jin.gif" ALIGN=”right” class = "p"/>
        <div class = "bio">Hi, my names is Jin, and I am a rising senior at John Jay Senior High School. Math has always been my favorite subject since I love problem solving. I decided to join Girls Who Code because a teacher recommended it to everyone. Girls Who Code was very interesting, and it was helpful to know the surface of different languages. The program also taught me that coding is implicated into many different types of fields. In the future, I will continue to use coding in things I like. </div><br CLEAR=”left”/>

        <h3>Sarah Dagmy</h3>
        <img src ="Sarah.gif" ALIGN=”right” class = "p"/>
        <div class = "bio">Hi, my name is Sarah, and I'm a rising junior of the class of 2020 at Yeshiva of Flatbush Joel Braverman High School. In my free time I love to read, write, code, and make a difference. As the only girl in my grade to do STEM I feel passionate to motivate other girls to join a tecnological field. Being a part of Girls Who Code has been such an amazing and educational experience. GWC has inspired me to join the tech field and inspire other girls to do so too.  </div><br CLEAR=”left”>

      <img src = "work.jpg" class = "img"/>
      <p class = "j"> As three women interested in technology and starting our journey at Girls Who Code, we would like to make other women more aware of the change in gender gap of technology. We explain some of the different areas in tech and provide jobs for our users to apply to. We want our users to be able to network with others, so we provide a networking page whereby we list important people in tech and allow our users to contact them via LinkedIn. Another one of our page is called Women in Tech, and this is where we want to raise awareness of the need for women in these fields. The future is technology, and we want to educate others on it, so tech us out.</p>
